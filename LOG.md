# LOG — Android Alpha (P3) ladder A0→A7

Execution log for the unattended session that runs the `Android_Alpha_roadmap_spec.md`
milestone ladder while Brandon is away (2026-07-30 → ~2026-08-02).

**Evidence standard (inherited):** "ran it and saw it" or it did not happen. Every claim
below is followed by output produced *in this session*. Where a result was inherited from a
previous session's build cache, it is labelled as such and **not** counted as evidence.

Re-verification commands for everything here live in [`AUDIT-REQUEST.md`](AUDIT-REQUEST.md).

## A0 — Environment probe + lane selection · 2026-07-30 · **COMPLETE**

### A0.1 Ground truth: the spec's central premise was stale

The roadmap spec states `target_repo: github.com/ShivaClaw/careerseeker-android # 404 as of
2026-07-30`, and JULY-SUMMARY §S7 states "**P3 = the Kotlin app itself = DOES NOT EXIST YET**
(repo 404 as of 2026-07-30)". Both are **wrong as of this session**. Verified first, before
any code, per the spec's own instruction to verify ground truth:

```
$ git ls-remote https://github.com/ShivaClaw/careerseeker-android.git

(+ refs/pull/1..5)
```

The repo exists, is private, has **5 PRs** and a substantial app already built by prior
sessions. The session's working directory `C:\Users\bkirk\Documents\careerseeker-android`
*is* a clone of it.

**Consequence for the mission.** The ladder is not greenfield. A1 (scaffold + CI), A2
(vector conformance), and much of A3/A4 already exist as real, tested code. Re-scaffolding a
fresh project at `%USERPROFILE%\careerseeker-android` — which the spec's contingency
describes for the 404 case — would have **orphaned working, CI-green code**. Decision
recorded in A0.6.

The reference repo matched the summary exactly, so S3 is trustworthy for `careerseeker`:

```

### A0.2 Toolchain probe

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| JDK | `openjdk 21.0.10` at `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr` (runs Gradle; modules pin toolchain 17) |
| `ANDROID_HOME` | unset in env; SDK present at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` — exported per-command |
| SDK platforms | `android-36.1`, `android-37.0` (project needs `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 37 — **satisfied**) |
| Build-tools | `36.0.0` |
| Gradle | 9.6.1 via committed, sha256-pinned wrapper |
| Disk free | 826,742,239,232 bytes (~770 GiB) |
| Network | reachable: both GitHub remotes cloned/queried this session |

### A0.3 Normative contract read in full

`docs/Sync-Protocol.md` @ `claude/p4-entitlement` (`d5bdb9d`), 474 lines, read end-to-end via
`git show` against the **local** reference clone — zero writes to that repo, no worktree
created, because a parallel session owns its working tree this week (it currently sits on
`codex/beta-M0-preflight`).

Contract points that drive the remaining ladder: §3 unknown top-level fields MUST be
rejected; §3.1 the **envelope** (not the ciphertext) is capped at 1 MiB; §4.3.1 the
application summary now carries a nullable `outcome`; §4.3.2 entitlement is
`{original_json, signature}` with standard-base64 signature and `purchaseState == 0` in the
**raw** JSON; §5.3 `key_id` mismatch rejected **before** decryption; §6.1 the receiver
persists its high-water seq across restarts; §10 rejecting for the *wrong reason* is a
failure.

### A0.4 Vector drift quantified

Upstream `claude/p4-entitlement` ships **25** vectors. The phone has vendored **20**, pinned
at `fff4bce9790788217d72be882f776b882993d640` (a P1-era commit) in
`core/src/test/resources/sync-vectors/VECTORS.lock`.

Missing on the phone — exactly the P4 acceptance material:
`entitlement-valid`, `entitlement-not-purchased`, `entitlement-tampered-json`,
`entitlement-wrong-package`, `entitlement-wrong-product`.

This is the single largest gap between "what the phone proves" and "what the contract now
says". It is A2 + A6 work.

### A0.5 Baseline: what actually passes, executed in this session

First invocation reported `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` with `55 up-to-date` — i.e. it **reused a prior
session's cache**. Under the evidence standard that is *not* a result I may cite, so every
test was forced to re-execute:

```
$ ./gradlew --no-daemon :core:test :app:test --rerun-tasks
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 36s
35 actionable tasks: 35 executed
```

Parsed from the JUnit XML written at 20:44–20:45 on 2026-07-30:

| Suite | Tests | Failures | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core…ProtocolTest` | 11 | 0 | 0 |
| `core…ProtocolVectorsTest` | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| `dashboard.replica.DemoFixtureTest` | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| `dashboard.replica.EnvelopeApplierTest` | 16 | 0 | 0 |
| `dashboard.ui.ScreensFromFixtureTest` | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | **0** | **0** |

`checkCoreIsAndroidFree` also ran and printed `:core is Android-free.`

Note the prior handoff cites "17/17 Robolectric" for `:app`; the actual current count is 25
(3 + 16 + 6) because later commits added evidence-applier tests. I report what I ran.

### A0.6 Decisions taken (reversible ones preferred, per the mission brief)

1. **Work inside the existing repo, not a fresh scaffold.** Re-scaffolding would duplicate
   and strand CI-green code. Reversible: nothing is deleted; new work is additive on a new
   branch.
2. **Base branch = `claude/p4-pro` (`d9f95fd`, identical to `claude/p2-replica`).** It is the
   branch the program already designated for the P4 phone half, and it is the common ancestor
   of the `p5-store` line — so this work does not force P5 to merge first. Rejected
   alternatives: basing on `p5-store` (would invert merge order and entangle un-audited store
   staging), basing on `main` (has **no app code** — see A0.7).
3. **Branch naming follows the spec** (`claude/android-a<N>-<slug>`) even though the repo's
   own convention is phase-named branches. Explicit instruction wins; branch names are
   trivially renameable if Brandon prefers the house style. First branch:
   `claude/android-a0-probe`.
4. **Lane A (full).** SDK, platform 37, and build-tools are present and an APK assembles
   locally. Evidence in A0.8.
5. **No pushes yet.** The repo is private and prior sessions pushed branches without opening
   PRs, by house rule ("Brandon decides when to open draft PRs"). Bundles go to the Desktop at
   every milestone so nothing is trapped in a working tree.
6. **`docs/Sync-Protocol.md` is never edited**, and no worktree was created in the reference
   repo — reads only, via `git show`.

### A0.7 Findings recorded for later milestones (not fixed in A0)

| # | Finding | Where it lands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F-1 | **CI never runs `:app:test`.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `checkCoreIsAndroidFree`, the vector-drift check, `:core:test`, `assembleDebug`, `lintDebug`, and the analytics-classpath check — but not the 25 Robolectric tests. They are ungated. | A1 |
| F-2 | Vendored vectors are 5 behind upstream (A0.4). | A2 |
| F-3 | **`main` has diverged from the code branches.** `main` carries docs-only commits (HANDOFF, checkpoints, P4/P5 runbooks) that are absent from every code branch; the code branches carry the app, absent from `main`. Any future merge must reconcile both lineages. Flagged, not touched — merge policy is Brandon's. | Handoff |
| F-4 | README still says "**P0 — scaffold.** No product features yet"; the repo has a Room replica and five screens. Also missing the spec-mandated PROVISIONAL note on `applicationId` (the id itself is already correct: `app.careerseeker.dashboard`). | A1 |
| F-5 | `EnvelopeApplier.appOf()` does not parse the nullable `outcome` field that protocol §4.3.1 now defines; the replica has no outcome projection. | A6 |
| F-6 | `:core` has **no strict envelope parser**. §3 requires rejecting unknown top-level fields; `ReceivedEnvelope` is constructed field-by-field by callers, so an unknown field is silently dropped rather than rejected. No vector covers this, but it is a documented MUST. | A2 |
| F-7 | `EnvelopeReceiver` checks `ciphertext.size > MAX_ENVELOPE_BYTES`, but §3.1 caps the **whole envelope**. A ciphertext just under 1 MiB plus headers exceeds the limit and is accepted. | A2 |
| F-8 | `EnvelopeReceiver.kindOf()` hand-scans plaintext for the first `"kind"` substring instead of parsing JSON. Untrusted carried text containing `"kind":"…"` ahead of the real field would misroute. Untrusted job text is exactly what this envelope carries. | A2 |
| F-9 | `DemoFixture` seeds `auditOk = true` — a fabricated audit verdict. It is labelled demo by `StatusBanner` on every screen and is wiped by the first real payload, so it is honest today; worth re-checking when the Evidence screen gains prominence. | A4 (review) |

F-6/F-7/F-8 are hardening, not vector failures: all 25 upstream vectors' stated behaviours
are unaffected. They are recorded because §10 is explicit that passing the vectors is the
floor, not the ceiling.

### A0.8 Lane A confirmation — APK built in this session

The first assemble was also cache-inherited, so it too was forced:

```
$ ./gradlew --no-daemon :app:assembleDebug :app:lintDebug --rerun-tasks
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 32s
49 actionable tasks: 49 executed
```

`:app:lintDebug` passes with `warningsAsErrors = true` and `abortOnError = true`.

Artifact produced at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Size | 12,147,666 bytes |
| Built | 2026-07-30 20:47:03 local |
| sha256 | `7CF785A95511DBFBFA08E72567FEB9588BFA3C6C0CF78EDFFB9BC0EC4B542861` |

The only build noise is `Unable to strip … libandroidx.graphics.path.so`, a benign
debug-packaging notice from AGP, not a project defect.

**Lane A is selected and demonstrated.** No `BLOCKED.md` is needed for A0.

### A0.9 Prohibitions honoured in A0

No pushes anywhere; no PRs; no edit to the reference repo (reads via `git show` only, no
worktree created); no Cloudflare/Play/Google-console/email/purchase/account actions; the
relay was not contacted at all in A0; no secrets read, printed, or committed.
